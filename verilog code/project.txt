Project Details
---------------
Project Title: Simon

Project Description: Memorization game. Sequence of LEDs will light up, user must replicate the same sequence on a set of switches and send the replicated signal using another switch. Points rewarded for successful replication.

Code URL (please upload a copy of this file to your repository at the end of the project as well, it will
serve as a useful resource for future development): https://github.com/McCoubs/SimonOOOOH/tree/master/verilog%20code


Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?: Create and display a random sequence of lights.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?: Matching inputs to sequences.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?: Score keeping, high score keeping.

What is your backup plan if things don�t work out as planned?
Don't track high scores, keep the game simple.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board 
(be sure to e-mail Brian if it�s anything beyond the basics to make sure there�s enough to go around)
None.

Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?: We learned to store data to compare against user input, kept state machines to control point in game.

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?): Cool implementation of popular simon game.

Why did you personally choose this project?: We found that this game would be of decent challenge to us while allowing us to explore all aspects of what we have learned in CSCB58. Also,
simon has been a very popular game in our lives and found that it could be very relatable.

Updates
-------

Week 1: Finished design of all state machines and function of the project. Finished the coding of the controller module, as well as the VGA instantiation

Week 2: Finished design and implementation of beginning VGA screen as well as minor game logic and changing of screen.

week 3: Finished game, allowing for one sequence at a time, added high scores.

Week 4: Presented game, went changed send switch to a further switch to prevent clutter around input switches.
